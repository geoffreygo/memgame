# Memory Game

Memory Game is my first React app. I used the npm package create-react-app as starter code. React is quite powerful, but also complicated. Using JSX is sometimes intuitive and sometimes arcane. The object is to click on each hero's card without clicking on the same one twice. Sounds easy right? 

Not so fast! Every time you click on one, they all rearrange on the screen! One amazing aspect of React is the ability to quickly and easily format an array full of objects and put them all on the screen, which is how the cards with the heroes' pictures are created. I enjoyed programming this, I hope you enjoy playing it!
